# Hints for Bank Account with Error Handling

## Hint 1: Struct Design
Design an `Account` struct with fields for ID, owner name, and balance. Consider what data types are appropriate for each field.

## Hint 2: Error Types
Think about what can go wrong in banking operations: insufficient funds, invalid amounts, account not found, etc. Create custom error types for these scenarios.

## Hint 3: Custom Error Implementation
Implement the `error` interface by creating a struct with an `Error() string` method. Include relevant context in your error messages.

## Hint 4: Input Validation
Always validate inputs before performing operations. Check for negative amounts, nil pointers, and other invalid conditions.

## Hint 5: Balance Checking
For withdrawal operations, check if the account has sufficient funds before modifying the balance. Return an appropriate error if not.

## Hint 6: Thread Safety
Use `sync.Mutex` to protect account operations from race conditions when multiple goroutines access the same account.

## Hint 7: Error Wrapping
Use `fmt.Errorf` with the `%w` verb to wrap errors and provide additional context while preserving the original error.

## Hint 8: Testing Error Scenarios
Write tests that verify both successful operations and error conditions. Use type assertions to check for specific error types.
