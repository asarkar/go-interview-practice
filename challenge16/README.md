# Challenge 16: Performance Optimization with Benchmarking

In this challenge, you will optimize several Go functions for performance, using benchmarking to measure your improvements. You'll work with a set of common but inefficient implementations and apply various techniques to make them faster without changing their functionality.

## Requirements

1. Optimize the following functions while preserving their behavior:
   - `SlowSort`: An inefficient sorting implementation
   - `InefficientStringBuilder`: A function that builds large strings inefficiently
   - `ExpensiveCalculation`: A CPU-intensive calculation with unnecessary work
   - `HighAllocationSearch`: A search function that allocates excessively
   
2. For each optimization:
   - Use Go's benchmarking tools to measure performance before and after
   - Document the approach you took and the improvement achieved
   - Ensure the function still passes all tests
   
3. Apply techniques such as:
   - Reducing memory allocations
   - Using more efficient algorithms
   - Taking advantage of Go's standard library
   - Removing redundant calculations
   - Using appropriate data structures
   
4. Run benchmarks with different input sizes to analyze algorithmic complexity
5. The included test file verifies both correctness and performance improvement
